Cartagena is a city located in Murcia, south-east of Spain. It's been there for more than two thousand years and that's all I'm going to write to describe it. There's a lot of other fun trivia you can [read here][cartagena]{:target="_blank"} if you have a minute.

To me, it's a beautiful place to visit every single time we go on holidays to [La Manga](../../gallery/minor-larger/). You can have a peacefull walk in its streets, full of an amazing architecture and historic sites, such as *The Roman Theatre of Carthago Nova* or the art-nuveau building *The Gran Hotel*. Once you arrive to the coast you find the port, full of little ships I'd love to sail for a day in those clear waters.

One of the our favorite places to eat is [D'Almansa][d'almansa]{:target="blank"}. The restaurant was placed in La Manga, but in 2015 they moved to Cartagena so we kept going there for the amazing food they serve. If you have a chance, try the caramelized eggplant and you'll be coming there over and over.
