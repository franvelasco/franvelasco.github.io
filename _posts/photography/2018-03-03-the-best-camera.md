I usually carry my Fuji when I leave the house if I don't have a specific plan, just in case. You never know where you can end up, and having that need to document every day of my life makes it even more serious. I think it has to do with my poor memory. 

This Saturday I had to walk the dog of my in-laws –a labrador retriever called *Martín*– before going out to dinner, and that's specific enough to leave the camera at home. Fade to black. My new iPhone SE enters the scene. I knew the camera was excellent compared to the old Xperia Z3 and I took it out to snap a few photos.

The quality of the images is not a big deal, I must say. It is a very capable camera in good light, but the image quality degrades very quickly when you enter the realm of darkness. Anyway, I didn't use the full potential of its camera. Now I know you should use an app with manual settings or at least not push it too much. It's a little smartphone with little sensor and lens anyway.
