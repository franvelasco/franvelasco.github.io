A few weeks ago I visited Porto for four days with my wife and the kids. And two trolleys and a few gadgets, including my camera, an X-E3 with the 23ƒ1.4 and the 50ƒ2. I don't know why, one of the nights I was mulling over the idea of building something around the concept "Document your life", be it a community, a web directory or something where we can leave our virtual business card and connect with people like us. It seems that documenting your life is something in itself, call it a project, a philosophy or whatever you feel like. It's not only the fact of taking pictures of your surroundings, your family, environment or work, in the rare case you bring the camera along, but doing it actively and consciously with an end in mind.

It was two or three years ago that I started looking for and finding people, not just photographers, who spent time and dedicated effort documenting their lives. I think one of the first was Patrick Laroque, and to a lesser extent, Kevin Mullins. In no time I was immersed in the discovery of that culture, motivations, processes… almost a way of seeing life through the viewfinder. Little by little and with the birth of my first child, I started to do one of those projects where you snap a photo every day, well planned from day 1, all the photos in landscape and using the same processing.

The first time I sat down to watch the series grow to 40-50 images, something clicked in my head. Seeing that person change in such a short time stirred something inside me. I assure you that it is not the same to see that same video of some strange than to see your child changing by the day. Creating something so personal that someone will appreciate in the future seemed like my ultimate work. I knew that I was going to document my life even more consciously than I had done in recent years.

A few months later, one of my favorite photographers, Matt Day, published [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSjkBZkEilE){:target="_blank"}this video where he addresses the subject from a point of view that gradually became more obvious to me: being present, something that is achieved by integrating the camera into your routine, shooting intuitively and more importantly, keeping the machine close by always. Now everything fit together, I think for me it was the missing piece to finish assembling the whole puzzle that I had in my head. In a very simple way, he explained how to do it, the mentality behind it, the reasons and the motivation that led him to document his own life. Having both a boy and a girl at home caused me even more empathy, everything in that video is strangely close to me.



Soon after, I discovered Linda McCartney's work with her family. Thousands of photos of Paul and his children in unspecial or unattractive moments, but that speak to me directly from the heart. If you do not know that part of her work, look for it and take a look because it is worth it. And from there I have jumped to a few, not many, photographers who are documenting their lives, trips, families, day to day. The last one I follow is Life, Unintended.

That is why I have written this piece of text, because it does not seem that there are many people willing to share that part of their lives. I do not do it, I do not publish mine, and I find it very brave to do so. But being so private, it's totally respectable.
