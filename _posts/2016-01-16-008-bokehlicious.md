This is what happens when you use a Helios 44M-6 58mm Æ’2 in a Fuji with an speed booster. *Swirly bokeh everywhere!* I'm so glad I found this little gem in a flea market in Naples where I paid 10 euros to get it with an old Zenit camera. It is not the sharpest or cleanest lens, but it is a very fun one to use, that's for sure.

It's 9:20 in the morning, so I guess it's time to start my day job.
