Once again, Cecilia takes me on an excursion. This Sunday we visited Segovia, and one of the monuments that striked me the most was the [Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segovia_Cathedral){:target="_blank"}. I am not going to rant on architectural technical data or the construction dates because I would be cheating or copying it from Wikipedia: just clic the link for that.

What I can assure you is that the best thing about visiting places like this is having [my little Art Historian](https://www.instagram.com/mynamesce/){:target="_blank"} by my side who is telling and teaching me what I want to know about every thing I am seeing while walking through buildings or looking at  centuries old works of art. When I'm able to write without screwing up, I will tell you something interesting.

Until then, I can only show you the photos here so you can feel through my eyes what I feel in our trips through the nearest and known universe.
