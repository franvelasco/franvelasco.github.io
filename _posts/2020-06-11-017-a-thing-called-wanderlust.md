Wanderlust is that strong desire you feel when you want to travel and explore the world. If you're like me, you want to see the world and experience everything it has to offer. 

My wife and I started to travel as much as we could the very first year we lived together. Incidentally, that was the very first year we were together also, so one could say we've done it since we met. We even know each other a few hundred miles away from our hometowns!

For now, we'll have to wait to travel again, but we never stopped planning that big journey we'll be getting into whenever possible.

These are the photographs we printed two years ago for our living room, taken on New York, London, Hong Kong, Lauterbrunnen, Bangkok, Luzerna and Ayuthaya. I guess it's time to print new ones adding Morocco or Berlin.
