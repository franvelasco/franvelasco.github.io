The battery in my Macbook was swelling too much and I have not found a better excuse for a visit to the center of Madrid than taking it to the Apple Store in Puerta del Sol.

Fortunately, besides my own insurance coverage, Apple will take care of the repair. That means a new battery and a new bottom cover, making my super machine a completely new computer.

Taking advantage of the wonderful February afternoon, Max in his stroller and I walked all the way up Alcalá Street to home, while still surprising us with the beautiful architecture of one of the longest streets in Madrid. I can now cross *"Walk From Downtown To Home"* off my to-do list. Next time we will walk the other way around.
