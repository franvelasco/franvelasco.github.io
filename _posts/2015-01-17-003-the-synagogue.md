One of the buildings that really caught my attention on our visit to Toledo was this 12th century Jewish synagogue, which since the 15th century and after expelling the Jews, was used as a church, at which time it changed its name to Synagogue of Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca.

I'm not going to lie to you: I read it in the pamphlet they gave us with a pass that included all the monuments and historical buildings of the city, *tourist mode ON*.

The truth is that this is a beautiful building, at least on the inside. That often makes me wonder if the buildings of our time will be visited a few hundred years from now by tourists from the future, although something tells me that the answer it will be a simple *no*.
