After a previous visit to Montejo to celebrate the new year, we came back on the 3rd of January to celebrate [los Reyes Magos][reyes]{:target="_blank"} three days earlier, given that the whole family of Cecilia would only be together until that very day. After a breakfast made of the famous [Rosc√≥n de Reyes][roscon]{:target="_blank"} and a hot chocolate made by the grandmother, we went for a walk around the area up to the frozen lake.

Once we were there, we enjoyed throwing stones at the pond to see how it sounded and pulled chunks of ice from the edges. It may seem a little boring to you, but the truth is that it was quite the opposite. Surrounded by a very beautiful landscape in the [Montejo de la Sierra][montejo]{:target="_blank"}, accompanied by cousins and friends, and always with a joke in the air, the walk felt very refreshing. It was so cold, also!

I can't complain at all about my Christmas holidays, although it goes without saying that I miss my family.
