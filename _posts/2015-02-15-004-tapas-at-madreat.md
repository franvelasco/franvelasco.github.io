It will never cease to amaze me how many things you can do in Madrid any day of the week. That Sunday, Cecilia and I got up early –reasonably early– to visit the [Thyssen Museum][Thyssen]{:target="_blank"} and then went for a snack to [MadrEAT][MadrEAT]{:target="_blank"}, which is in his own words: "*An open space to host food trucks, stalls, vans, carts and containers in a monthly basis*". And they do it well, and it's nice, so nice to have street food in your city.

As we were there, we grabbed some nachos as an appetizer, some croquettes as we walked, and then we stopped to try the hot dogs from the stall with more queue in the whole market. For dessert we got an amazing Nutella pancake. And everything was delicious, accompanied by an amazing sunny weather. with a cloud that began threatening to unload on us but that in the end it went away.

The only bad thing to mention is that MadrEAT is only held on the second weekends of each month, so we will wait until March to return. In the meantime, keep discovering my new city.
