# If you're wondering what's on my head these days, this is it.

<br>

Crafting new fonts to finish the 22/22 project. I'm three years late to the party, so it's about time!

---

Listening a lot of 90s punk rock again, specially Bad Religion, NOFX, Pennywise, Green Day and The Offspring.

---

Looking forward to our weekend to Barcelona to see Pennywise, Bad Religion and Propagandhi live.

---

Playing guitar and bass as crazy, and writing new songs. It's been a decade since I wrote any music and it feels great!

---

Just started reading The Martian, by Andy Weir. I loved Project Hail Mary!
