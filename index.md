Hello, my name is *Fran Velasco*. I live in Madrid with my wife *Cecilia*, my kids *Max* & *Oli*, and a cat named *Petra*. I like to travel as much as possible, I design things in *Seabell Studio*, I take my *camera* everywhere, I play *bass guitar*, I love/hate social networks, I collect *Marvel* books and *Hot Wheels*, and I'd eat *pizza* every day.
