Hello, my name is *Fran Velasco*. I live in Madrid with my wife *Cecilia*, my kids *Max* & *Oli*, and a cat named *Petra*. I like to travel as much as possible, I craft fonts at *Seabell Type*, create stuff at *Boredom Kills Creative*, I take my *camera* everywhere, I play *bass guitar*, I love/hate social networks, I collect *Spider-Man* comic books and *music*, and I'd eat *pizza* every day.
